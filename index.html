                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <h3>HI, I'M EMMANUEL</h3>

                <p>
                    I used to work as a Warehouse Foreman, where I handled inventory,
                    coordinated logistics, and made sure daily operations ran smoothly.
                    That role taught me how to stay organized, work with precision, and
                    take responsibility seriously.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, I'm transitioning into virtual jobs / remote jobs. I'm a Certified 
                    QuickBooks and Xero ProAdvisor, trained in bank reconciliation, payroll,
                    accounts payable & receivable, and financial reporting. I bring strong
                    work ethics, committed to learning, improving, and helping businesses
                    keep their finances clean, accurate, and stress-free.
